A long time ago there was an old man that lived on top of a mountain. 
With him lived a humble servant who listened and agreed to everything he said. 
One time these two people where being atttacked. 
The servant drove them off but the old man died. 
The servant then dedicated his life to fighting.
Later that day the servant was sparing with the elderly.
This angered the the servants master very much.
Master Bill-Bottom, the masters name, unseathed his sword and dueled the servant.
Swords clashing, master against servant, the veiwing of this sparked many fights throughout the city.
This only continued and caused a civil war to break out which killed many and caused many tomatoes to die.
